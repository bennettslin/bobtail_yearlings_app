Hi xxx, my name is Bennett and I'm in a rock band called Bobtail Yearlings.

(One or two lines to mention and compliment their work. Then tie their work or their interests to my project in the next line or two.)

We have a project called Yearling's Bobtail that's one part double album, one part audio webcomic. An example song:

And we promise to help rock music win a Pulitzer prize! It's stated in the project overview:

If you find our project intriguing, I'm hoping to ask if you can help spread the word about our Pulitzer promise, perhaps in a tweet? Or if you know someone who might be interested in working with us in any way, we'd also appreciate a favorable mention! This is a very complex project to get off the ground on our own, after all.

I'm always happy to talk. Thanks so much for your time!

Best,
Bennett
