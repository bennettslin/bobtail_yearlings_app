Hi xxx, I'm in a rock band called Bobtail Yearlings.

(One or two sentences to mention and compliment their work.)

(Tie their interests and their work to the next lines.)

I'm looking to release a project called Yearling's Bobtail that's one part double album, one part audio webcomic. An example song:

I also promise to help rock music win a Pulitzer prize! I mention this in the project overview:

If you find this project promising, may I ask you to spread the word about my Pulitzer promise? It could be just a quick tweet, or else a favorable mention to anyone who might be interested in working with us. (Do briefly mention that it needs help from others, but be positive about it.) Of course, an album review or interview would also be appreciated!

Thanks so much for your time.

Best,
Bennett

# Scraps
The reason I ask is because I made the "mistake" of creating a project that's far too complex to get off the ground without help from others. And the indie labels and music press aren't set up to recognize this as a valid problem. But it's a catch-22, because any artist who faces this problem will always lack the exposure to bring attention to it!
