Hi xxx, my name is Bennett and I'm in a rock band called Bobtail Yearlings.

(One or two lines to mention and compliment their work. Then tie their work or their interests to my project in the next line or two.)

We have a project called Yearling's Bobtail that's one part double album, one part audio webcomic. An example song:

And we promise to help rock music win a Pulitzer prize! Which we explain in this project overview:

If you find our project intriguing, may I ask you to help spread the word about our Pulitzer promise? It could be a quick tweet, or a favorable mention to anyone who might want to work with us. This is a rather complex project to get off the ground on our own, so we're hoping

Of course, an album review or interview would also be appreciated. Thanks so much for your time!

Best,
Bennett
