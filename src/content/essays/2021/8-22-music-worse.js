Is music getting worse? Put me in the camp of those who would say so. To be sure, I only believe this about rock, not hip hop or pop. However, few would argue that hip hop and pop are getting better. So if rock is worse, then on average all music is worse.

I'm also not claiming that no good rock music is being made today. But if we rank the decades, it can't be a seven-way tie. One of them has to sit at the bottom, and it's hard to imagine it being any decade other than the one that just passed.

When people online defend the current state of music, they tend to use the same arguments. So I thought I'd provide a rebuttal to each one of them here.

**There are more artists doing more things than ever before.**

Yes, but until there's an apocalypse, every generation can make this claim. For the indefinite future, in every genre and every medium, an ever increasing number of artists will do an ever increasing number of things.

Yet no one seriously argues that we're living in a golden age of classical or jazz.

**There's amazing music out there if you're willing to find it.**

But this was also true in the past. If you were willing to look, there was a ton of amazing music beyond just the amazing music that everyone today knows about.

Listening to a lesser-known band today, I might think, wow, they're as good as the [Promise Ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Promise_Ring). Which is good, since the Promise Ring were a good band.

But people today don't talk about the Promise Ring. They talk about Nirvana. Without a Nirvana today, will people tomorrow talk about today's Promise Rings? Or will they just keep talking about Nirvana? I suspect the latter.

**There was bad music in the past as well.**

Of course. But as Lord Acton [once said](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/617485-judge-talent-at-its-best-but-character-at-its-worst), "Judge talent at its best but character at its worst." In other words, we rate artists by their hits, not their misses. No one knocks Beethoven down a few pegs because he composed [Wellington's Victory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellington%27s_Victory). We're not judging character here.

The same rule applies to entire decades as well. Whatever dreck the 60s came up with, they also had the Beatles. Where's today's Beatles?

**Every generation has its naysayers.**

Sure, there will always be grumpy old cranks who think the music of their own time was the best. But when your naysayers are young, you have a problem.

A while back when I taught music theory, I had a casual chat with my students. Some of them seemed to harbor the hope that music only ever seems epic in retrospect. That every generation that came before had also failed to appreciate what they had until it was gone.

But then I told them how awesome it was to witness the birth of grunge in real time. That when Nirvana exploded onto the scene, it felt like we were watching history in the making. The 60s, 70s, and 80s each had their moment to shine, and now it was our turn.

My students looked crestfallen.

**What are the chances that something so reliably good would suddenly become bad in our time?**

What are the chances in *our* time? I don't know. But at *some* point in time? One hundred percent. Because no renaissance ever lasted. Why would rock and roll be any different?

We'd all love to live during a renaissance, yet throughout history, their absence has been the default. So you have to assume they can't be willed into being. They only come about by fortunate circumstances.

You also have to assume they're hard to sustain once that fortune runs out. Because every generation born into a renaissance will take it for granted, and eventually one will let it die. Nothing in their lifetime ever taught them that a renaissance requires active stewardship.

Well, does anyone today talk about being responsible stewards of the rock and roll renaissance?

**Judging music by its timbral variety is a bunch of crock.**

Okay, I agree with the defenders on this one. There's all sorts of research these days showing that loudness has gone up over time, while variety in tone and timbre has gone down. But none of this proves that music is getting worse.

To do that, we don't need data analysis. We need systems thinking. Inefficient systems lead to lower results, and indie rock is an inefficient system by design. Clearly the quantity isn't any lower, which means it lowers the quality. And now every band is expected to be indie.

In their heyday, the major labels took big risks to discover bands no one knew about, like Radiohead. By contrast, the indie labels make safe bets on local bands with an established following. They've never promised to do anything else, even after the majors imploded.

By thinking in systems, we can see that the indies won't be discovering the next Radiohead. And they themselves admit they're not trying to.

**What kind of person would rather say that today's music is worse?**

I can't speak for anyone else on my side. But why do I say it? Because I want things to get better. It's like saying the climate is getting worse. You can't fix global warming until you acknowledge that. And when you do, no one reads it as an indictment of today's youth.

But talk about musical climate change, and suddenly it's the young people who take offense. So let me clear up this matter. Anytime someone says today's music is worse, regardless of their intent, it's always an indictment of previous generations. Not the coming ones.

Now let's fix this thing!
