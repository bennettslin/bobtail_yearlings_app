Is music getting worse? Put me in the camp of those who would say so. To be sure, I only believe this about rock, not hip hop or pop. But few would argue that hip hop and pop are getting better. So if rock is worse, then on average all music is worse.

I'm also not claiming that no good rock music is being made today. But if we rank the decades, it can't be a seven-way tie. One of them has to sit at the bottom, and it's hard to imagine it being any decade other than the one we just left.

When I go online to see what others think about the current state of music, those who defend it tend to use the same set of arguments. So I thought I'd provide a rebuttal to each one of them here.

**There are more artists doing more things than ever before.**

Yes, but every generation can make this claim. For the indefinite future, in every genre and medium, an ever increasing number of artists will be doing an ever increasing number of things.

And for the past several decades, anyone could have said this about classical or jazz. Yet no one believes these genres are still in the midst of their golden age.

**There was bad music in the past as well.**

Of course. But we rank artists by their hits, not their misses. No one knocks Beethoven down a few pegs because he composed [Wellington's Victory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellington%27s_Victory).

The same rule applies to entire decades as well. Whatever dreck the 60s came up with, they also gave us the Beatles. Where's today's Beatles?

**There's so much good music out there if you're willing to find it.**

(rewrite)
But this was also true in the past. It wasn't just Nirvana and every other famous band that kids today know about. There were so many amazing but less popular bands if you cared to look. Yo La Tengo, Slint, Cap'n Jazz, the Promise Ring… to name a few.

Yet few kids today get into these obscure bands from the past. Why would they? They'd rather listen to their own— along with Nirvana. So why would kids tomorrow bother with today's obscure bands? They can just listen to their own as well— plus Nirvana.

**Every generation has its naysayers.**

Sure, there will always be grumpy old cranks who think the music of their own time was the best. But when your naysayers are young, you have a problem.

Back when I taught music theory, I had a casual chat with my students. Some of them seemed to harbor the hope that music only ever seems epic in retrospect. Maybe every generation before had also failed to appreciate what they had until it was gone?

But then I told them how awesome it was to witness the birth of grunge as it happened. That when all those Seattle bands exploded onto the scene, it felt like we were watching history in the making. The 60s, 70s, and 80s each had their moment to shine, and now it was our turn.

My students were crestfallen.

**What are the chances that something so good for so long would suddenly turn bad in our time?**

What are the chances in *our* time? I don't know. But at *some* point in time? One hundred percent. Because no renaissance ever lasted. Why would rock and roll be any different?

We'd all love to live during a renaissance. Yet throughout history, their absence has been the norm. So you have to assume they can't be willed into being. What's needed is a very fortunate— and very unlikely— set of circumstances.

You also have to assume they're hard to sustain once that fortune runs out. Because every generation born into a renaissance will take it for granted, and eventually one will let it die. Nothing in their lifetime ever taught them that a renaissance requires proper stewardship.

With that said, have you ever heard anyone talk about being a steward of the rock and roll renaissance?

**Judging music by its timbral variety is a bunch of crock.**

Okay, I agree with the defenders on this one. Yes, research based on analyzing thousands of popular songs over the years has shown that tonal and timbral variety has gone down over time. But by what supreme authority does this actually mean today's music is worse?

The way to make objective arguments isn't through data analysis. It's with systems thinking. For example, inefficient systems lead to worse results. And the indie system is inefficient by design.

Before signing unknown artists, the indie labels need to see them build a following on their own. This is inefficient, because the labels could stump for these artists and get better results for less effort. Now they're stuck trying to promote artists who've logged more time chasing a following than developing a craft.

By thinking in systems, we can expect indie music to be worse. That's why no other genre that cares about quality does things the indie way. Yet for many who defend today's music, the indies are its saving grace!

**Each generation can only be judged by what was possible in its own time.**



The indies themselves don't claim to be better.

In their heyday, the major labels took big risks to discover bands no one knew about, like Radiohead. By contrast, the indies make safe bets on local bands with an established following. They've never promised to do anything else, even after the majors imploded.

**What kind of person would rather say that today's music is worse?**

I can't speak for everyone. But why do I say it? Because I want things to get better. It's like saying the earth's climate has gotten worse. You can't fix global warming until you acknowledge that.

And once you do, no one reads it as an indictment of today's youth. But talk about musical climate change, and suddenly it's the youth who take offense. So let me clear this up. When I say music is getting worse, it's an indictment of previous generations. Not the next ones.

(Expand upon.)
There are fewer big fish in the ocean.

Now let's fix this thing!
