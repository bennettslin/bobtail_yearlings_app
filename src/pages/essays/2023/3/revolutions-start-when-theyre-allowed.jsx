### Intro

Chris Rock once made an [insightful observation](https://www.vox.com/xpress/2014/12/1/7313467/chris-rock-interview), that Barack Obama winning the American Presidency was a story of White progress, not Black progress. Black Americans weren't waiting for one of their own to finally be good enough to become President. There have always been Black individuals who would have made a great President. Instead, they were waiting for White people to allow a Black person to be President. What was being tested wasn't Black competence, but White tolerance. And in 2008, White people finally passed the test.

Well, there's a similar dynamic at play in rock. The younger generation is never waiting for one of their own to finally start a revolution. There are always artists out there trying to start one. I know: I'm one of them. Instead, they're always waiting for the older establishment to allow it. What's being tested isn't the youth's ability to start a revolution, but their elders' willingness to accept a revolution whose values and ideals most likely refute and supplant their own.

We've never needed this insight in rock to have revolutions, because every previous establishment passed the test with flying colors. We took it for granted that this would always be the case. Sadly, once Generation X became the new establishment, they dropped the ball, which is why rock music of the past two decades has been so terrible. Unfortunately, the Millennials exhausted all their time as youth to figure this out. But hopefully, now that I'm pointing this out, Generation Z won't suffer the same fate.

### A brief history of rock revolutions

How did this happen? Let me indulge in some generational stereotypes.

When then Boomers were young, they were naive free spirits. Meanwhile, the establishment, members of the previous generation, were business-minded squares. They didn't always get what the long-haired freaks were all about, but they didn't care. They just wanted to make money. So it was the perfect recipe for revolution.

Example of George Martin and the Beatles.

Then the Boomers grew up and became the new establishment. They were no longer naive, but they were still free spirits. Meanwhile, the next generation, Generation X, were a bunch of cynical ideologues. Still, in its own way, this was also a good recipe for revolution.

Example of Pearl Jam.

But then Generation X grew up. They were no longer cynical, but they were still ideologues. And ideologues make for a terrible establishment.

### Ideologues are the worst establishment

To understand why, consider the case of Geffen, who first signed Guns n' Roses, and then turned around and signed Nirvana, a band with opposing principles. Geffen had no ideology. We just take it for granted that they don't.

By contrast, Generation X has an ideology, which is that artists who build grassroots followings from the bottom up are superior to those who need top-down investment from centralized institutions. If no one is willing to be their first fan, it doesn't matter if millions are willing to be their millionth fan.

By having an ideology at all, Generation X effectively promised that once they became the establishment, they would never allow the next generation to start a revolution based on opposing principles, which the next revolution almost certainly can be expected to do.

But many of the greatest artists in history could only have made it through top-down investment. Radiohead were so little known, for example. Vanilla Ice had stigmatized the idea of a white rapper so thoroughly that even though everyone could see Eminem was talented, it didn't translate into actual fandom. He needed Dr. Dre to take him under his wing.

And this doesn't just apply to music. If *Ulysses* had to build its prestige from scratch, no one would be willing to be its first fan. So you could predict that once the Bobtail Yearlings made our "*Ulysses* of rock albums," it would fail to build a grassroots following. And consequently, the establishment run by Generation X would refuse to allow it.

And that's what happened. So I wasn't allowed to give the world *Yearling's Bobtail*, which means I wasn't allowed to start the interdependence revolution.

### Indie rock is the Millennials' hair metal

Let's do a thought experiment. It's the mid 00s, and indie rock's values have become the mainstream. Social media companies speak of empowering artists. Streaming platforms say their algorithms reflect the will of the people. Artists who previously benefited from major label deals, like Amanda Palmer, knew to position themselves as indie saviors.

Now, imagine that the Bobtail Yearlings have been allowed to come along and start the interdependence revolution. Self-sacrifice instead of self-empowerment.

If you're indie, you might find these values baffling. And yet, it's precisely because they baffle you that deep down, you realize that interdependence would have been the Millennials' true revolution. It would have been their grunge, while indie rock would have been their hair metal.

Like hair metal, indie rock was passed down from the previous generation.
And like hair metal, it was subversive in its heyday. But by the time it was passed along to the next generation, it was a caricature of its former self.

The analogy is so perfect that even in the absence of an interdependence movement, it makes little sense to call indie rock the Millennials' grunge by default. It makes more sense to simply say that the Millennials never got their grunge movement. Generation X might remember the year before Nirvana broke, when Firehouse and Trixter were on the radio. For Millennials, that year got dragged out to two decades.

### Conclusion

If you're a Millennial, all of this is, of course, depressing. But there's a silver lining to this: If the ones being tested aren't the young, but the old, then technically, you weren't the ones who failed. It was Generation X who failed you. Meanwhile, your true test lies ahead:

Now that you're on your way to becoming the establishment for the next generation, will you allow them, Generation Z, to have the revolution that was denied to you?
