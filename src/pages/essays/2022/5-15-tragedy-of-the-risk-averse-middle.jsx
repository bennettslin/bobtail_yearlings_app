* Points to make:
    * Vicious circle, because when everyone is risk averse
        * The bandwagon effect is intensified
        *   Decision making by the bandwagon effect is a feature, not a bug
        * Everyone follows everyone else's lead
    * An indie culture can't be disrupted from within
        * It must be disrupted from without

* Something weird is about to happen
    * That will require an explanation
        * To the future generations who'll learn about it in music history
    * Because it's quite counterintuitive if you've never studied behavioral psychology
        * And even if you have, you likely couldn't have predicted it in advance
* The weird thing that's about to happen
    * Is that the Bobtail Yearlings will go around indie rock and release Bobtail Dominoes
        * And then parlay the attention and leverage they get from that
            * Into gaining exposure within indie rock for Yearling's Bobtail
    * Future generations will find this confusing
        * Shouldn't these be two separate stories about two separate bands?
        * Why did the Bobtail Yearlings need to go for this one-two punch?
            * Why wouldn't Yearling's Bobtail, by itself, be enough to win over indie rock's gatekeepers?
    * Believe me, I've been asking this last question for the longest time myself
        * But I now understand it had to be done this way
            * And I'm the only one who knows why
        * Like I said, the explanation is so counterintuitive
            * That the only reason I understand it
            * Is because I personally lived through it
* Over the years, every now and then, I'd have an opportunity to speak with a smaller indie label
    * I'd begin with a spiel about how indie rock's broken signaling game leads to perverse incentives and negative runaway effects
        * But they'd cut me off, saying yes, indie rock is a dumpster fire, we know this already
        * Which always threw me off
            * Because I have many ideas for changing the system, but I have no power
            * While they have at least some power, yet they're doing nothing about it?
    * They'd then agree that Yearling's Bobtail is very impressive
        * But I wouldn't hear from them again, and afterward I'd see them on social media
            * Carrying on as usual
            * Hyping the latest band they signed that built up a social media following, but that I wouldn't hear about anywhere else
    * I was promising to immortalize them in rock music history
        * As the label that kickstarted the next revolution
        * And yet they seemed to *prefer* staying unknown and struggling financially?
            * Obviously, if your explanation depends on seeing someone as a caricature, then it's probably not correct
            * But I really had no other explanation
* Then I read Adam Grant's Originals
    * He talks about how in any hierarchy
        * The people eager to take risks are the ones at the bottom with no power
            * And the ones at the top who are safely empowered
        * While those in the middle who are precariously empowered are the most risk averse
    * I turned this over in my head for a long while
        * And gradually I understood that this was the missing piece of the puzzle
            * That explains *everything* that confused me about indie rock
* Grant didn't give this phenomenon an official name
    * But it's so crucial to understanding the problem with indie rock, yet so counterintuitive
        * That I think we need to give it one to forever cement it in people's minds
        * So I'll call it the tragedy of the risk-averse middle
* If any system ever devolves into a dumpster fire
    * A few at the bottom
        * Will happily go all in on creating the next disruption
    * And a few at the top
        * Will hedge their bets and invest in this next disruption, just to have a stake in it
        * Even while they still have a stake in the current system
    * But those in the middle can't bet against themselves
        * They can't simultaneously own a stake in both the current system and the next disruption
        * So ultimately, they're going to stick with the current system that pays them
            * Even if it's just a pittance
    * So as long as you've got a healthy number at the bottom and the top, you'll do fine
* The problem with indie rock
    * Is that it's a culture that aspires to take power away from the top, and give it to the bottom
        * Putting *everyone* in the precariously empowered middle
            * So everyone is too risk averse to create the next disruption, or to bet on it
        * And this is why the dumpster fire continues to burn unabated
* I now understood why no indie label wanted to sign the Bobtail Yearlings
    * I was offering them a stake in the next disruption
        * Thinking that every label thinks like Geffen, who signed both GnR and Nirvana
        * But unlike a major label, indie labels aren't big enough, and thus secure enough
            * To disrupt the current system that pays them a pittance
    * In the past
        * We couldn't stand both the fat cats at the top
            * And the bottom feeders like Jerry Heller
        * Because they pursued opportunities for disruption in a way that exploited artists
    * That's why we root for the indie labels in the middle
        * We know that when they see opportunities for disruption, they'll pursue them responsibly
        * What we don't realize is that their risk aversion means they *don't* see these opportunities
            * Instead of exploiting the next NWA
            * They'll simply ignore them
    * That's why they all rejected Yearling's Bobtail
        * Anyone at the bottom or top would recognize it as an opportunity for disruption
        * But for those in the middle, it was nothing more than a burden
* I also now understood why no one else out there is even remotely like me
    * Which always confused me
        * Why am I the only one doing what I'm doing?
        * Because believe me, being the only one of your kind *isn't* a good thing
            * There's strength in numbers
    * In the same way that indie rock makes the labels risk averse by taking away their power
        * It also makes artists risk averse by requiring them to seek power
    * I was a carryover from a previous generation that never bought into indie rock's ideals
        * So unlike younger bands, I never bothered to strive for power on my own
    * And since I spent my whole life at the bottom with nothing to lose
        * The urge to disrupt the current system, rather than to work with it, always came the most naturally for me
    * I feel lucky, because I certainly didn't plan it this way
        * I don't wake up every morning and think, having no power is awesome! What risks can I take because of it?
* And finally, I understood why there's so much disagreement over whether rock music has grown stagnant
    * It's basically a disagreement
        * Over whether revolution is a requirement or just a nice-to-have
    * We the music fans see perfectly well that rock music has grown stagnant
        * Artists from a few years ago who were just as good as the ones being promoted today
            * Have been completely forgotten
            * Their stock has permanently plummeted, never to be revived again
            * So it's obvious where today's artists are headed in a few years
    * Since we've got nothing to lose, of course we want revolution
    * Yet when we speak up to point out that these times are ripe for disruption
        * We feel gaslit by the music writers and other tastemakers in the middle
            * Who tell us that music is as amazing as ever
        * They're perfectly content to have the future be a steady rotation of good but unremarkable artists
    * The truth is that they're not trying to gaslight us
        * Their risk aversion means that the present reality
            * Is all they can envision
            * So as far as they're concerned, it really is the best it can be
    * This is another new thing in rock music history
        * The new tastemakers, like the new gatekeepers,  also see disruption very differently from everyone else
        * And we haven't yet learned to account for this new reality
* This is a new thing in rock music history
    * The old gatekeepers and tastemakers who sat at the top
        * Saw disruption the way we at the bottom did
        * So we interpolated and assumed that everyone in between was the same
    * But the new gatekeepers and tastemakers who sit in the middle
        * Now see disruption very differently from everyone else
        * And we don't yet recognize this new reality
            * So we haven't yet learned to account for it
* If you think about it, this means that the only way to disrupt an indie culture
    * Is with a one-two punch
    * A band like the Bobtail Yearlings
        * Would first need to create a disruptive work like Yearling's Bobtail that put them at a disadvantage with indie rock
        * And then to gain leverage outside of indie rock with a work that's only adjacent to the music business like Bobtail Dominoes
* But this is depressing, because everything is cyclical
    * Surely there's going to be another movement like indie rock in the distant future
        * Where the whole point is to take power away from the top
            * And give it to the bottom
    * Except what are the chances that the future
        * Will have its own band like the Bobtail Yearlings
            * Who can pull off a similar one-two punch?
        * Because remember, indie cultures also make *artists* risk averse
* This is why I created BYCombo
    * From now on, anytime the music fans at the bottom
        * Feel gaslit by the gatekeepers and tastemakers in the middle
            * Whose risk aversion means they won't ever see the next disruption for what it is
    * They can bypass the middle and come to BYCombo to know what's out there
        * If there are any bands trying to disrupt the current system, BYCombo will tell you
    * And because BYCombo is a nonprofit and has no decision making power
        * We're powerless just like you
        * Which means we'll always see what you see
