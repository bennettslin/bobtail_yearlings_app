### Our mission statement

**The Bobtail Yearlings aspire to be the most historically consequential rock band of the 21st century! We'll do so by leading the interdependence revolution while amassing a solid body of creative works.**

### Our guiding principles

##### Historical consequence

In the past, the rock music of the English-speaking world was [*the* canon](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/100-greatest-artists-147446). It was always the most original, and often the most accomplished. But today's indie rock isn't better than any foreign canon out there, which is why it seems so inconsequential.

To make history once again, bands need to be the best in the *world*— and this requires deliberate effort. And so every decision the Bobtail Yearlings make will be informed by our [five vowels of historical consequence](https://bobtailyearlings.com/essays/ongoing/five-vowels-of-historical-consequence).

##### Longevity

In classical music, the best artists got *better* with age. Beethoven, for one, composed his [magnum opus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphony_No._9_(Beethoven)) in his final years. This isn't the case in rock yet— which proves that these are still the early days of the canon.

As such, the Bobtail Yearlings promise to be a working band for as long as Bennett is alive. And we'll always take steps to ensure that our best works lie ahead of us.

##### Interdependence

To avoid sharing their earnings, indie artists spend time and energy on administrative work that would otherwise be handled by business partners. And some take this a step further, by choosing to create without collaboration. But what competitive edge could a solo artist working part time possibly have, to make them the best in the *world*?

This is why the Bobtail Yearlings will readily work with business partners, allowing us to focus solely on our craft. We'll also periodically bring in new bandmates to be equal collaborators, allowing us to create works greater than the sum of their parts.

##### Business partners

Studies show that people actually dislike creativity— and [experts more so](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/10/why-new-ideas-fail/381275) than all others. This is why, time and again, business partners who care most about backing great art— who thus pride themselves on knowing what great art looks like— end up backing the *least* creative works.

Meanwhile, the *most* creative works are often backed by those who are largely naive about art. For this reason, the Bobtail Yearlings prefer to work with business partners who take pride in knowing how to do business, not in recognizing great art.

##### Emotional intelligence

If the Bobtail Yearlings are to achieve our mission, then others should find it enjoyable to interact with us. And it should feel just as meaningful for us to work with each other. So each of us will vow to be a model of emotional intelligence, who'll treat others with empathy, kindness, and respect.

Of course, we won't hesitate to criticize indie rock as an ideology. But we'll always remind ourselves that those who've devoted their lives to it are people like us, and they're the heroes of their own stories.

##### Helping others

Mr. Rogers told us that when times are bad, we should [look for the helpers](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/198594-when-i-was-a-boy-and-i-would-see-scary). Well, times are bad now in rock. So why aren't there more helpers? It's because every indie artist's top priority is to be self-empowered— a trait that doesn't lend itself well to helping others.

And so the Bobtail Yearlings promise to be helpers, even if this puts us at greater risk of being exploited. We'll do so by making ourselves available to the bands who come up through [BYCombo](https://bycombo.com), our rock band incubator.

##### Roles

The band leader decides on the overall vision for the Bobtail Yearlings. For now, Bennett is our band leader, since this is the de facto reality. However, in the long term we should be open to having multiple band leaders, or even none at all.

The consequential works of this century will almost certainly combine different mediums in unprecedented ways. As such, we'll always be open to bringing in new bandmates who work in other artistic mediums.

Ideally, we would have one bandmate whose sole responsibility is to handle all our administrative work. This admin would also oversee development of our extracurricular projects, such as [*Bobtail Dominoes*](https://bobtaildominoes.com), [*Bobtail Method*](https://bobtailmethod.com), and of course, BYCombo.

##### Duties

Each Yearling will work forty hours a week to benefit the band, for the duration of their time in the band. This work will largely be self-directed. Examples include practicing one's instrument, writing song parts, and so forth. Naturally, touring and performing count as band work. Of course, we'll take holidays, vacations, and sick days off.

Some projects may require certain bandmates to learn new skills in a different domain. In such cases, the project manager will work with them to ensure that expectations are reasonable, and needed resources are provided.

##### Compensation

Everyone who's a Yearling during the creation of a project will be given equal credit and royalties. This includes the admin, as well as artists of other mediums. Of course, we're free to mention who contributed which parts, as Lennon and McCartney often did.

Ongoing earnings from our extracurricular projects will first go to new bandmates to grow their savings, if needed, up to a fixed limit. Any leftover amount will then go into our general band fund.

##### Recruitment

While we won't select new Yearlings on the basis of race or gender, we'll openly address the benefits of diversity and the hazards of unconscious bias.

We also understand the need to juggle band life with adult responsibilities. So if bringing a life partner into the band will help a bandmate maintain their commitment, then we'll do our best to make this work.
